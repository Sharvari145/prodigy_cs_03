🔐 Password Strength Checker  This is a simple Python script to evaluate the strength of a password and provide suggestions to make it stronger. It checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character requirements.

📚 Objective

The main objective of this project is to:
- Learn how password policies enhance security.
- Understand password validation using Python.
- Implement regular expressions (`re` module) to check for password rules.
- Provide meaningful suggestions to improve weak passwords.

🧠 Logic Used

The password is evaluated against 5 criteria:
1. Length Check – Minimum 8 characters.
2. Uppercase Letter – At least one capital letter.
3. Lowercase Letter – At least one small letter.
4. Digit – At least one number.
5. Special Character – At least one symbol (e.g., @, #, $, etc.)

Each satisfied condition increases the strength score. Based on the score, the password is rated from **Very Weak** to **Very Strong**.

 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (`re` module)
- Command Line Interface


📌 Outcome

- Enhanced understanding of password security standards.
- Hands-on experience with input validation in Python.
- Gained knowledge of regex and conditional logic implementation.
- Helped reinforce the importance of secure password practices.
